# Serotonergic-Modulation-of-Motoneuronal-Excitability-and-Muscle-Force-Generation-Computational-Study
This study investigates the impact of serotonin (5-HT) on motoneuron electrical activity and muscle force generation. Using a computational model, we explore how 5-HT receptors influence motoneuron excitability and muscle function at different stimulation frequencies.
